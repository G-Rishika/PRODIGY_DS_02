This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a mock dataset modeled after the Titanic survival data. The dataset is synthetically created using Python, mimicking key features such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and survival status. The primary goal is to analyze patterns and insights using basic data cleaning techniques, summary statistics, correlation matrices, and various data visualizations. The project includes handling missing values, generating visual plots such as histograms, heatmaps, and countplots, and exploring survival trends across different categories like gender and class. It serves as a foundational exercise for understanding data analysis workflows without needing to download any external files or connect to online datasets. The entire task is designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab, making it beginner-friendly and fully self-contained.
